### Analysis of developers-submissions.csv

With the spreadsheet in hands, two researchers manually analyzed the submissions in order to identify the invalid submissions.

We considered as invalid submissions:

- Submissions of old images (e.g. [tg7dwx1twjt11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/tg7dwx1twjt11.jpg), [emqdek3dgx051.jpg](https://i.redd.it/emqdek3dgx051.jpg), [BoaamNM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BoaamNM.jpg))
- Submissions of images that did not contain a workstation for software development (e.g. [weeku8hmdun31.png](https://i.redd.it/weeku8hmdun31.png), [bzKW7BY.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bzKW7BY.jpg),[7z6diya32xr41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/7z6diya32xr41.jpg), [91bz1vs9w3j41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/91bz1vs9w3j41.jpg))
- Submissions of edited images, animations, cartoons or similar (e.g. [I0rmt4y](https://imgur.com/a/I0rmt4y))
- Submissions of images at work (e.g. [hxupdsad01q21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/hxupdsad01q21.jpg), [sfm8ri4l20041.jpg](https://i.redd.it/sfm8ri4l20041.jpg), [COlGU8D.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/COlGU8D.jpg))$
- Submissions of images where the workstation was not very clear or was difficult to analyze (e.g. [](https://i.redd.it/v8taf68e3c841.jpg), [6npct2uc52h41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/6npct2uc52h41.jpg), [HKCyt7b.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HKCyt7b.jpg), [98oes67ueq051.jpg](https://i.redd.it/98oes67ueq051.jpg)).
- Submissions of images containing humans and/or private information.

Our paper is focused only on workstations at home, for this reason we disconsidered images at work.

Some users also submitted galleries instead of a single image (e.g. [5Cm4z](https://imgur.com/a/5Cm4z)). From these galleries, we selected the image that clearly captures the entire workstation (e.g. the gallery [5Cm4z](https://imgur.com/a/5Cm4z) was converted to [uaxM4xz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uaxM4xz.jpg)).
